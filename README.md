Hello! 🙌

I have over 7 years of experience as a Frontend Developer, and I possess a
strong understanding of API functionality, which I gained from my background as
a Fullstack developer. Although I am well-versed in both areas, I have
discovered that my passion for coding lies primarily in Frontend development. I
am an ardent learner, and I enjoy studying and expanding my knowledge to stay
up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in the field.
